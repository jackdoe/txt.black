when i introduce new service at work, some people are often upset,
sometimes i use go, sometimes java, c or perl/ruby/js.

whatever i choose some people are upset because i did not use whatever
they like.

i still do wander why would someone like certain language more than
some other?

they all suck.

just choose the one for the project that will help you to get to the
end faster, and will bite you in the ass in the more distant future.

when i choose java i end up fighting with the jvm (for low latency
high performant systems) about 30-40% of the time; not to mention i
have to bend and twist my models so it is performant; hotspot does not
let me code java in the way java has to be coded.

go with its opinions, is still lacking in stability and dependency
management (though making significant steps forward); also the panic
recovery is very weird

c i like the most; but well.. cost of maintaining large project is
just too hight, chasing memory corruptions bugd is certainly not fun.

perl/ruby is slow as fuck and untyped, but we have a lot of legacy
code, so in many cases exposing some functionality as a new endpoint
beats making a new service and rewriting the business logic.

js .. i never would&#39;ve guessed how annoying not having 64 bit
integers is. it was not once or twice i wanted to break my keyboard,
when i had to send 0xBAAAAAAAAAAD as a string, so i can decode it; not
to mention the volatile ecosystem; not to mention the transpilers..

clojure i love to write, but hate to read, even my own code from a
month ago(which is also the case with all my old code haha)


...

i hate them all.
