many cuts

little by little i managed to accumulate ~200E in monthly hosting fees
from few personal projects few euro here few there

* google cloud kubernetes costs like 120E

  after my startup failed i still had https://booknomads.com and
  https://txt.black deployed there that included haproxy, mysql and
  deployment controller managing few replicas and i didnt move them
  because i was too busy with other stuff

* had some droplets in digitalocean

  few old droplets on digital ocean 5E a piece

so overall now i moved all to digital ocean and cleaned up unneeded
stuff, took me whole day though moving the domains, recreating
deployment scripts and etc

still.. shutting down the startup's kubernetes cluster was very
emotional moment for me.

lets see what the future holds
