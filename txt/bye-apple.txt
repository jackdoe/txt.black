bye apple


finally sold my macbook and iphone

steps i took:

* sold my macbook
* bought android phone
* bought xps
* spent like 2 hours setting up linux with EXWM on it
* was happy

few of the main reasons i did that:
1) the keyboard is a piece of shit
2) nothing makes craftsman more unhappy
   than hating the tool you work with
3) it takes like 3 days to publish app
   on the app store, and you have to be 
   in the mercy of the apple god.

i just want to publish small apps from time to time
to share them with my friends

i want to be able to type on the fucking keyboard
after a small bread crumb touches it.

i want to be able to buy new ssd and ram in a couple 
of years without having to buy a new laptop


so i say,
goodbye apple
