elixir day 4


published https://hexdocs.pm/vowpal_fleet/VowpalFleet.html
to create cluster of wabbits using Swarm

notes:
* the combination of dynamic and static supervisors is very weird, in many cases i cant visualize the supervised tree

* still dont know how to properly test multi cluster setup
* i am still confused sometimes by genserver and supervisor way to pass params
* tried some fancy process managers (like porcelain) but System.cmd seems to be the best for me
* the pattern of wait-for-pid-file-to-appear seems to be working fine
* still not sure what will happen with hot-code-reload for the swarm handoff state


next:
* do the distributed testing setup for vowpal_fleet
* try to do hot code reload and see what happens
* investigate integrating this with phoenix
* make rest api endpoints on top of it
