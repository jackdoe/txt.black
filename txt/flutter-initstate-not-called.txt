# flutter initState not called


i started learning flutter and dart in the same time

setup went ok, then i decided to make an app that uses the top 100
guttenberg books.

so far so good i made a StatefullWidget taking a book and loading it
as a resource, everything compiles fine, but for my surprise the
State<>'s initState() function does not get called,

```
  ...
  String text;
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    getFileData(widget.path).then((b) {
      setState(() {
        text = b;
      });
    });
  }
  ...
```

i try everything, hot-reload like gazillion times, print from build()
works fine, but nothing made the initState get called

until i did hot-restart, and at this point everything worked fine

every time i try to learn something new, i jump in a pull with my
assumptions as a bathing suit this time it was particularly annoying

:D
