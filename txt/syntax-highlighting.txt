syntax highlighting


i dont use syntax highlighting, it has been 5 years since i stopped
using it, and it has been awesome.

syntax highlighting:

1) gazillion themes, each is pretty for subset of people;
   form-over-function

2) forces you into reading into the theme's patterns
3) underestimates or overestimates the value of comments
4) breaks the code flow


no highlighting:

1) makes all code equally important
2) comments are code
3) much faster to find what you are looking for because you are not
   distracted by 20 different colored words
4) it feels super cool and elitist
5) brings fear in anyone looking at your screen

now it is actually more difficult for me to read
highlighted code


if you are using emacs, init.el:

(global-font-lock-mode -1)
(global-hl-line-mode 1)

(set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "monospace"  :height 120)
(set-background-color "#eeeeec")
(set-face-attribute 'region nil :background "#babdb6")
(set-face-background 'hl-line "#dadada")
(setq-default line-spacing 1)
(blink-cursor-mode 0)
