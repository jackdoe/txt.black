this is how i make soup:

* get a pot and fill it with water to about 70%
* put it on the stove at medium heat
* take any vegetables you have, and slice them, not very thin, for
  example carrots i slice in 3 pieces.
* put them in the pot
* if you have any fish put it in as well, no need to cut it a lot, the
  meat will fall off the bones anyway
* wait
* take any spices you have, especially hot pepper and soy sauce, and
  put some in the soup
* wait some more
* eat the soup


thats pretty much it

PS: if you close the lid of the pot and you forget to stir, the water
will boil out at some point.

PPS: if the water boils out and you have a gas stove, it will turn off
the flame, and you will die from carbon monoxide poisoning, so make
sure you are not cooking at night. (unless you have a proper gas stove
that turns itself off when there is no flame)
