30 days have passed since I have blocked the news, and I mean all news. CNN,
Fox, BBC, hackernews and many others.

Its too much going on in the world. From COVID to the racism, from self driving
cars to child labor, from terrorism to slavery, from environmental to privacy
issues.

I felt responsible for everything. Its so much! The flood of despair coming my
way, from all directions, all the time. For every click I make, worse things
come up. And it never stops.

Thanks to me paying exactly 0$ per month for journalism, now I reap what I sowed.
Machine Learning optimized fear.

So I say fuck it.

Now, I just write code and play video games.

You should try to save at least one person in your life, and its OK for that
person to be you.
