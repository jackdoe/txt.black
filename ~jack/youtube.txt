I just blocked youtube on all devices in the house.

This shit is poison.

Poison to me, my wife and my daughter.

For every piece of content that makes us grow there are thousands that
just consume us. Guess which ones her feed get filled with?

Fucking lies, deception, fear, greed, anger, who can do the stupidest
self harm shit in public..

You know "taking candy from a baby", just imagine how easy it is to
clickbait children.

There is life changing content there, Feynman, Dirac, you can even
listen to Claude Shannon himself! And yet, 99% is garbage, and somehow
only garbage is recommended. You just keep getting in cycles, and it
only gets worse and worse. 

How did we let this happen?

It reminds me of this Feynman lecture (which sadly now I cant find
because it is on youtube..) given in the university of Auckland, where
he spoke about light and electromagnetic radiation, how bees see the
ultra violet, and how the pit viper sees infrared, and how even though
we cant see much of the electromagnetic spectrum, we have instruments
see even beyond, and we use those instruments to advertise soap.


Fuck it then, I will find a way to live without youtube.
