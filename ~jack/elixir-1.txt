elixir day 1


migrated https://txt.black from golang + gin and mysql to elixir +
cowboy and :dets

just for fun and practice

* made it personal instead of letting other people post (if you want
  your own user, just send me an email at info@txt.black)
* used simple persisted ets
  (https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/specifics/ets/)
* didnt use any templating language on purpose to see how it feels to
  manipulate strings in the language

the more i use elixir the more i like it
still sometimes i get confused, but the docs are great and they help
me a lot

* distillery is particularly nice
* ets functions are weird: [{{{:"$1", :"$2"},:"$3"}, [], [:"$3"]}]
* i am still not sure if i should do the pattern matching in the
  helper functions or in genserver callbacks
* took me a while to figure out that :dets.open_file/3 takes filename
  as atom: file: :"atom name";
* still not sure when my genserver gets terminated
* there was some confusion with mix.exs and applications: and what i
  can import at release time

todo:
* investitage more ets store
* still not sure how maps are implemented under the hood
* try dets plus raft and also Mnesia
  (http://erlang.org/doc/apps/mnesia/Mnesia_chap1.html)

anyway, day 1 complete, check out the code at
https://github.com/jackdoe/txt.black



EDIT:
the blog was moved to text files, so if you want to checkout the ets +
cowboy code check out c2c20f31eb94484f9653256b8c1e0e655a87b705
