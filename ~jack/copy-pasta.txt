Copy-Paste between machines

Sometimes I need to copy paste between the laptops, and I decided to
use berserk.red and `go install github.com/jackdoe/updown/cmd/encrypt`
to share an encrypted file:

make some key `echo $RANDOM > ~/.key && chmod 0600 ~/.key`, then
create rput and rget functions in zsh

rput() {
    encrypt -k ~/.key | ssh berserk.red -- bash -c 'cat > private/.clip' 2>&1 > /dev/null
}

rget() {
    ( ssh berserk.red -- cat private/.clip 2>/dev/null ) | encrypt -d -k ~/.key
}


from the other machine I just do
$ echo whoaaaa | rput

On the other one you can run 'rget | copy' and get the content in my
clipboard (after you copy the .key file of course)
