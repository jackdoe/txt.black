elixir day 2


published https://hex.pm/packages/vowpal_client

notes:

* IO still feels weird to me, especially when GenServer has to
  `receive` in handle_call/cast
* making docs is super nice experience, very easy and simple with
  MarkDown
* a bit annoying when i have handle_call({:a, something}..) and
  handle_call({:b, something}..) and it complains all the time


next steps:

* make distributed predictor using vowpal and `swarm`

0) one group per vowpal configuration (parameters like number of bits
   and etc)
1) any node receive the predict requests
2) train requests have to be copied to all nodes within a group
